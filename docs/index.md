### Project channel (JIRA Project -&gt; slack channel mapping)
Each JIRA project maps to one slack channel for sending notifications. 
Slack channel and jira project name have to be the same.
(convention over configuration)

#### Username mapping
Users need to have the same username on slack & jira

#### @vicky Private messages from bot to slack users
Each user has a private message channel with the bot in which they receive info messages which are relevant only to them.

#### Message Formatting
We use the following message formats sending messages to slack, see stories below on where/how this is used:

##### Simple format
*	&lt;issue type icon&gt; &lt;Number&gt; (clickable URL) &lt;Status&gt;: &lt;Summary&gt; @&lt;assignee nickname&gt;
*	&lt;commenter name&gt; ‚û† &lt;latest comment&gt;

##### Assign format
*	&lt;Name user who assigned&gt; assigned to you: &lt;issue type icon&gt; &lt;Number (clickable URL)&gt; &lt;Status&gt;: &lt;Summary&gt; 
*	&lt;commenter name&gt; ‚û† &lt;last comment&gt;

##### Summary format
*	&lt;issue type icon&gt; &lt;Number (clickable URL)&gt; &lt;Status&gt;: &lt;Summary&gt; @&lt;assignee nickname&gt;
*	&lt;description - first 5 lines&gt;
*	&lt;commenter name&gt; ‚û† &lt;last comment&gt;
