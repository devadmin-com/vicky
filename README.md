# Features
## JIRA Event Processing


## Slack Message Processing

### ticket info expansion in chats
When Users write a ticket number in slack the summary info for that ticket is displayed
Basically we want the https://www.nextup.ai/ functionality - we were using it before but now it processes Vicky’s messages… Another option would be to figure out how to make nextup not read Vicky’s messages…
-     <type icon ⚙⚡❗️> <Number (clickable URL)> <Status>: <Summary> 
-    <description - first 5 lines>
-    <commenter name> ➠ <last comment>


## General
### JIRA Project -> slack channel mapping
Each JIRA project maps to one slack channel for sending notifications. 
Slack channel and jira project name have to be the same.
(convention over configuration)

### Username mapping
Users need to have the same name on slack & jira

### Comment display truncating
Truncate display of comments to 256 unicode characters

### Icons indicating ticket type
 -    We use these in display as follows:
 -   ⚙ Type = ”Operations” tickets
 -   ⚡ Type =”Urgent bug” tickets
 -   ❗️ Priority=Blocker tickets (any type)


# Enjoy ;)
